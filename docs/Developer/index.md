## Developer Documentation

If you're developing Graphitti code, then here are your reference documents. Writing new code? Then *document it here*. Reading code that isn't obvious? When you figure out how it works, then *document it here* and *document it in comments in the code* (preferably, in the `.h` file in [Doxygen](../Doxygen/DoxygenStyleGuide.md) format.
